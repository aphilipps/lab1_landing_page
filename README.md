1. What worked/what didn't.

I didn't feel like I had too much difficulty creating the base website for a desktop screen, but had more difficulty when trying to scale the webpage for a smaller window size. Another thing that I though was somewhat difficult was keeping my css organized because it doesn't matter what order most items appear in within style.css.
